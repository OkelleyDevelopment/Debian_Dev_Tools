# Debian Dev Tools

## Install in a single command
### WITHOUT the Neovim Config

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Debian_Dev_Tools/master/dev_no_nvim_config.sh)
```

```



## Motivation

Practical bash scripting to automate the setup of the development
tools I use on a day-to-day basis. Writing this script has taught me some good basics
about bash and will be updated as I learn to optimize bash scripts.

## Installed Tools

- GIT VCS
- cURL
- neofetch
- neovim

- Discord
- Zoom
- Spotify
- My neovim config
