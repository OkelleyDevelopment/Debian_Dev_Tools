# Debian Dev Tools

## Install in a single command
Have curl installed and then run:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Ubuntu_DevSuite/master/dev_suite.sh)
```

## Motivation

Practical bash scripting to automate the setup of the development
tools I use on a day-to-day basis. Writing this script has taught me some good basics
about bash and will be updated as I learn to optimize bash scripts.

## Installed Tools

- GIT VCS
- cURL
- neofetch
- neovim
- xClip
- Discord
- Zoom
- Spotify
- My neovim config
