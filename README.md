# Ubuntu DevSuite

## Install in a single command

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Ubuntu-DevSuite/master/dev_suite.sh)
```

## Motivation

Practical bash scripting to automate the setup of the development
tools I use on a day-to-day basis. Writing this script has taught me some good basics
about bash and will be updated as I learn to optimize.

## Installs

- GIT VCS
- cURL
- neofetch
- neovim
- xClip

- Zoom
- Spotify
- My neovim config
