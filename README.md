# Debian Development Suite

## Motivation

Manual installs of tools that are commonly used in a development environment becomes cumbersome
and can cause tools to be forgotten between installs. With this bash script automating the process,
all the tools will be installed and ready to go!

## Prerequisites

NOTE: Must have an internet connection to install the tools.

## Program Execution

Assuming correct permissions

```
./dev_suite.sh
```

If permissions are incorrect, then run:

```
chmod 755
```

## Future Goals

- Add a small yes/no gathering for which tools to install saving space for unwanted software.
- Convert this script for Arch based distros

## Installed Tools

- GIT
- NodeJS
- Pip3
- neofetch
- NeoVim
- xClip
- Discord
- Spotify
- My custom [NeoVim Config](https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Nvim-Config)
