# Ubuntu DevSuite

## Motivation

Practical bash scripting to automate the setup of the development
tools I use on a day-to-day basis. Writing this script has taught me some good basics
about bash and will be updated as I learn to optimize.

## Installs

- GIT VCS
- cURL
- neofetch
- neovim
- xClip
- Discord
- Zoom
- Spotify
- My neovim config
